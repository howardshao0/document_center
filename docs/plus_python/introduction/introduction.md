# Introduction

## Basic Features

**Kneron PLUS** stands for *Platform Library Unified Software* which is a framework comprising new software(SW) and firmware(FW) design for KL520, KL720, and KL630 (and alpha for KL730).

In order to run the inference of models on Kneron AI devices, there are three parts of AI application development are required:

- **model development**
- **software development**
- **firmware development**

Below diagram depicts three parts of development in a big picture.

However, this document only focuses on the **software development** and the **firmware development**. For the **model development**, please refer to the [Toolchain Docker](../../toolchain/manual_1_overview.md) part.

In comparison with the previous SW/FW framework, this aims to simplify the design flow for AI applications development.

Below gives some definitions regarding the Kneron PLUS:

- **PLUS** is a software library developed by Kneron and it allows users to manipulate the AI device through sophisticated C/C++/Python API.

- **KP** API is part of the PLUS written in C/Python and it provides simplified functions and examples to help users develop their software applications. For the complete list of KP API, please refer to another document.

- **NEF** represents for **NPU Executable Format** which may comprise one or multiple models and it can only work on Kneron's SoC. This package comes with some NEFs for demonstration purposes. We will use the **Tiny Yolo v3** NEF as the model input on KL520 in our inference examples.

- **Firmware** is the code responsible for driving Kneron SoC and make it work with the software library. The KDP2 firmware can work with the PLUS and it has prebuilt images included in the PLUS.


The features which PLUS Supported are listed below:

## Advanced Features for Enterprise Version

Besides the basic features, there are few advanced features provided in Kneron PLUS Enterprise:

**Note**: Most of the advanced features and examples are C code only. Only **Update Kdp2 to Kdp2 Flash Boot** has the python version example.
